 ##  Insights:

Sales peaked in 2020, showing growth over 2018 and 2019.

2021 sales dropped drastically – either due to partial data or an external/internal disruption (e.g., pandemic, supply chain issue, business slowdown).

This needs further investigation.

## 2 Monthly Sales Distribution

January and February dominate, with February alone contributing nearly $280,000.

The remaining months have low and relatively flat sales.

##  Insights:

Heavy seasonality exists – possibly driven by early-year promotions, clearances, or consumer trends.

Opportunity: Spread promotions or product launches more evenly throughout the year to stabilize revenue.

## Insights:

Canada leads, with the USA close behind – these two markets drive nearly all revenue.

Mexico sales are minimal – potential to either explore the cause or redeploy efforts elsewhere.
